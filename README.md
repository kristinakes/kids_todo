# Todo list for Kids with Bonuss

DEMO: https://kristinakes.github.io/kids_todo/

## Project idea
I had an idea on how to help kids to easily track they daily/weekly tasks at home and also include some fun bonus system:
 - add their tasks
 -  mark them completed
 -  see the status 
 - get bonus if all tasks are completed
 - see if some tasks are missing on the list (as there should be not less than 6 tasks added)
 - if 6 tasks completed - double points, if 10 completed - tripple points
 - cash out their collected points by sending automaticaly generated mail to parents

 For this project I used local storage.
